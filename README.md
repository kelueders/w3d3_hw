Fixes to Make:

1. Get rid of the required parameter in the Move_Tutor Class so that a pokemon does not need to be put in during the instatiation
2. Get if statement to work in order to prevent learning more than 4 moves.
3. Utilize the parent class in order to prevent having to do the same request in order to find out the possible moves for the pokemon
